# moody-kittens
One issue that may appear to be a bug is that the kittens start with a randomly generated affection, 
I thought this was closer to reality. However that means that it is possible for a kitten to be added 
as "gone" or "happy" which kind of breaks the game.
If I had more time I would make the affection number visible, to make it more obvious that the pet and 
catnip buttons are actually doing something.
